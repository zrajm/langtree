# Some Language Dendrograms

These are some language-related tree diagrams that I’ve created using [D3.js].
The language family trees are based on language data from [Glottolog].

The diagrams can be viewed on their [web page] (on Github pages).


# TODO

Stuff I wish to add in the future is listed in the [TODO] file in the
repository (it’s in Emacs [org-mode] format).
